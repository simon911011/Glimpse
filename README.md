Glimpse
=======
Glimpse is an iOS application that promotes Project 365. Users can take a photo each day for 365 days â€“ not only to record each day of their live but also improve their photography skills. At the end of a year, the user will have a complete record for each day!

Glimpse is still work in progress. More things to come includes better UI, tags, support for more media types, and a better way to review a year!
